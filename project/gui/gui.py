#We are going to be using Kivy for a GUI
#First download pygame then download Kivy. Here is the download site:
#http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
#I tried downloading from the Kivy site but had lots of issues, 
#this site allowed the downloads to work on Windows OS and worked with Kivy's test code.
